# 🏰 alternative UI

This is a non-free fork of Umbrel's non-free dashboard, designed to feel familiar for users coming from Umbrel and older Citadel versions,
while still having unique Citadel features and a partially different design.

Because it's non-free, it should not be the default implementation for the dashboard.
We will still maintain this in the future, but new features will get added to our FLOSS UI faster.

Currently, this dashboard is the default on Citadel, but we're working on changing that.

This dashboard contains code from [Casa](https://github.com/Casa/V2-Casa-Node-UI) and [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-dashboard).
